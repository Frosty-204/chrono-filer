**III. High-Level Architecture:**

The application will be designed with a separation between the core logic (backend) and the graphical user interface (frontend).

- **Core Logic (Backend):**

    - FileManager: Handles all direct file system interactions (listing, reading, writing, moving, copying, deleting).

    - MetadataExtractor: Responsible for extracting and parsing file metadata (dates, type, size, permissions).

    - OrganizationEngine: Implements the logic for filtering files, applying rules, matching patterns, and determining target directory structures. It orchestrates FileManager for actual file operations.

    - RuleProcessor: Manages and interprets user-defined rules, including standard filters, regex patterns, and directory structure templates.

    - RenameEngine: Handles logic for bulk renaming operations.

    - OperationHistory: (For Undo) A stack of command objects representing reversible operations.

    - SettingsManager: Manages loading and saving application settings and user preferences.

- **GUI (Frontend):**

    - MainWindow: The main application window, containing and managing the various UI panels.

    - FileBrowserPanel: Displays the file system (tree and list views), handles file/directory selection.

    - PreviewPanel: Shows previews of selected files.

    - MetadataPanel: Displays detailed metadata for selected items.

    - OrganizationConfigPanel: UI for users to select source(s), define filters, rules, output structure templates, and choose organization options (dry run, move/copy).

    - BulkRenamePanel: UI for configuring and previewing bulk renaming operations.

    - FeedbackManager: Handles displaying progress bars, status messages, and error dialogs.

- **Interaction:**

    - The GUI will interact with the Core Logic components. For instance, user actions in OrganizationConfigPanel will configure the RuleProcessor and trigger the OrganizationEngine.

    - Long-running operations (file scanning, moving, copying, organizing) will be executed in separate worker threads to keep the UI responsive. Progress will be communicated back to the GUI for display.

    - A signal/slot mechanism (Qt) or a similar event-based system (GTK with GObject signals) will be used for communication between components.


**IV. Technology Stack Recommendations:**

- **Programming Language: Python 3**

    - **Rationale:** Rapid development, extensive standard library for file operations (os, shutil, pathlib), metadata (stat, mimetypes), and regex (re). Strong support for GUI toolkits. Its I/O-bound nature makes Python suitable as performance is less CPU-critical here.

- **GUI Toolkit: Qt 6 (via PySide6 or PyQt6) or GTK 4 (via PyGObject)**

    - **Qt (PySide6 - LGPL):**

        - **Pros:** Mature, comprehensive widget set, powerful layout and styling capabilities (can adapt to GNOME/KDE themes), excellent signal/slot mechanism, good documentation, QML for potentially richer UI elements if desired later.

        - **Cons:** Can sometimes require more effort to feel perfectly "native" on GNOME than a GTK app.

    - **GTK 4 (PyGObject - LGPL):**

        - **Pros:** Native look and feel on GNOME and GNOME-based desktops. Strong integration with the GNOME ecosystem. Modern features in GTK4.

        - **Cons:** API can be less straightforward for some developers compared to Qt. Might look less integrated on KDE/other environments if specific theming isn't perfect.

    - **Recommendation:** **Qt 6 with PySide6** is slightly favored for its comprehensive nature and flexibility in creating a polished UI that can work well across different Linux desktop environments. However, if targeting GNOME primarily, GTK 4 is an excellent choice.

- **Key Libraries (Python):**

    - **File System & OS:** os, shutil, pathlib (standard library).

    - **Metadata:**

        - os.stat, stat, mimetypes (standard library).

        - Pillow: For image dimensions, type detection, and generating previews.

        - Optional: python-magic (for more robust MIME type detection).

    - **Image Handling (Preview):** Pillow (for loading/manipulation), then displayed via QPixmap (Qt) or GdkPixbuf (GTK).

    - **Regex:** re module (standard library).

    - **Configuration/Settings:** json module (standard library) for JSON files, or configparser for INI-style files.

    - **Threading:** threading module (standard library) combined with GUI toolkit's mechanisms for updating UI from threads (e.g., QThread.signals in Qt, GLib.idle_add in GTK).


**V. Development Stages/Roadmap:**

- **Stage 0: Foundation & Initial Prototyping (2-3 weeks)**

    - Setup: Dev environment, Python, GUI toolkit, Git repository.

**VI. Key UI/UX Design Principles:**

1. **Intuitive & Clean:** Prioritize ease of use. Avoid overwhelming users with too many options at once.

2. **Clarity & Feedback:** Users must always understand what the application is doing. Use progress bars, status messages, and visual cues.

3. **Efficiency:** Design for users managing large numbers of files. Keyboard shortcuts and streamlined workflows are important.

4. **Safety First:** "Dry run" is essential. Destructive operations should be confirmable. Undo is a key goal.

5. **Consistency:** Maintain consistent design language and interaction patterns throughout. Adhere to general Linux desktop environment guidelines.

6. **Discoverability:** Make features easy to find and understand. Use tooltips and clear labeling.

7. **Responsiveness:** The UI must never freeze. Long operations must use background threads.


**VII. Potential Challenges and Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **Performance with Large File Sets:**

    - **Mitigation:** Use os.scandir() for faster directory iteration. Thread I/O operations. Lazy load data. Optimize filter logic.

2. **Undo Functionality Complexity:**

    - **Mitigation:** Implement the Command Pattern. Start with undo for simpler operations (move/rename) and expand. Clearly define the scope of undo.

3. **Regex Usability:**

    - **Mitigation:** Provide pre-defined common patterns, a real-time regex tester, and clear examples/documentation.

4. **Robust Error Handling:**

    - **Mitigation:** Extensive try-except blocks for all file operations. User-friendly error messages. Options for handling errors in bulk operations (skip, abort, retry).

5. **Cross-Desktop Appearance (if Qt is chosen and high fidelity is needed everywhere):**

    - **Mitigation:** Utilize Qt's styling system, platform plugins, and consider tools like qt5ct/qt6ct for user-level theming. Prioritize a clean, neutral default style.

6. **State Management:**

    - **Mitigation:** Well-defined data models. Clear separation of UI state from application data. Use signals/events for state change notifications.


**VIII. Phase 2 Implementation Status:**

**âœ… ALL PHASE 2 FEATURES COMPLETED:**
- âœ… Enhanced File System Operations (create, delete, rename with undo support)

- âœ… Improved File Viewer (extended formats, find functionality, basic syntax highlighting)
- âœ… Advanced Organization Engine (move/copy, regex filtering, bulk renaming)
- âœ… Configurable Settings Panel (comprehensive settings dialog with organization, preview, UI, and advanced options)

**Phase 2 Summary:**
Phase 2 development is now complete! The application includes all planned advanced features with comprehensive settings management, enhanced file operations, improved metadata display, and a robust file viewer with syntax highlighting support.

**Known Issues (Deferred to Phase 3):**
- Syntax highlighting may not render correctly on some desktop environments (Hyprland, light themes)
- Comprehensive theme system implementation pending

**IX. Testing and Quality Assurance:**

1. **Unit Tests:** For all core logic modules (file management, metadata, organization engine, rules, renaming). Mock file system where feasible.

2. **Integration Tests:** Test interactions between core modules and between UI and core logic.

3. **Manual UI Testing:** Essential for workflows, visual checks, and usability on target desktop environments (GNOME, KDE).

    - Test with diverse file sets: many files, large files, complex names, varied types.

    - Test edge cases: permissions issues, disk full, network paths (if supported).

    - Thoroughly test conflict resolution and "dry run" accuracy.

4. **Performance Testing:** Use sample large datasets to identify and address bottlenecks.

5. **Usability Testing:** Gather feedback from representative users throughout development.

6. **Regression Test Suite:** Build up a suite of tests to run regularly to catch regressions.

7. **Test Data:** Maintain a repository of test files and directory structures designed to cover various scenarios.


This development plan provides a structured approach to building Chrono Filer. Flexibility will be key, and priorities may shift based on development realities and early user feedback.
